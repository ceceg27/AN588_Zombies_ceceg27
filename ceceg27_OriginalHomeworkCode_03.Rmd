## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#homework 3

#loading the data set
```{r}
library(curl)
f <- f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN588_Fall21/zombies.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d)
```

#challenge 1
#running summary will give us means for each quanititive variable in the population
```{r}
summary(d)
```
#means
#height = 67.63
#weight = 143.91
#zombies killed = 2.992
#years of education == 2.996
#age = 20.05

#challenge 2
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
#gender vs height
x = ggplot(d, aes(x=gender, y=height)) +geom_boxplot()
x

#gender vs weight
y = ggplot(d, aes(x=gender, y=weight)) +geom_boxplot()
y

#gender vs zombies killed
g = ggplot(d, aes(x=gender, y=zombies_killed)) +geom_boxplot()
g

#gender vs years of ed
c = ggplot(d, aes(x=gender, y=years_of_education)) +geom_boxplot()
c

#gender vs age
w = ggplot(d, aes(x=gender, y=age)) +geom_boxplot()
w
```

#challenge 3
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

#age vs height
q = ggplot(d, aes(x=age, y=height)) +geom_point()
q

#age vs weight
a = ggplot(d, aes(x=age, y=weight)) + geom_point()
a

#as age increases weight and height increase, but it seems to be a more linear relationship for height than it is for weight. 
```

#challenge 4
```{r}
qqnorm(d$height)
#normal
qqnorm(d$weight)
#normal
qqnorm(d$age)
#normal
qqnorm(d$years_of_education)
#non-normal
qqnorm(d$zombies_killed)
#non-normal

```
#examining the non-normal variables further
```{r}
hist(d$zombies_killed)
#poissons distribution
hist(d$years_of_education)
#poissons distribution
```

#challenge 5
